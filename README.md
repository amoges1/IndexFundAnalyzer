# IndexFundAnalyzer

IndexFundAnalyzer is a Python program that web scrapes information from etfdb.com for a single or list of index fund(s). It retrieves the top 15 holdings of an index fund, primarily their names and associated weights. This information is copied onto your an Excel spreadsheet to review. The program runs as allows:

  1. Set a list of index funds for the web scraper
  2. Sit back and wait until the Excel spreadsheet is generated
  
 With this program, it is now easy to see which stocks/bonds are most popularly and heavily invested by index fund providers. However, this is by no means an instrument for financial decisions, as risks and other factors are always present. I just thought it'd be nice to know what the big mutual fund providers are up to. Again, I guarantee no financial success- just information.
